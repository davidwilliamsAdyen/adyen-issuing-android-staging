## Removed
- **hasWallet** API function as this check is now performed implicitly by the **createSdkOutput** API function.
- **createWallet** API function as this call is now performed implicitly by the **createSdkOutput** API function (if required).
- **onActivityResult** API function as the Activity result returned from the Google API is now handled internally within the SDK provisioning flow.

## Changes
- The **getSdkOutput** API function has been renamed to **createSdkOutput** and now will create a wallet if a wallet ID is required to be present in the SDK output and there is no pre-existing wallet.
