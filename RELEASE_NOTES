## Removed
- hasWallet API function as this check is now performed implicitly by the createSdkOutput API function.
- createWallet API function as this call is now performed implicitly by the createSdkOutput API function (if required).
- onActivityResult API function as the Activity result returned from the Google API is now handled internally within the SDK provisioning flow.

## Changes
- The getSdkOutput API function has been renamed to createSdkOutput and now will create a wallet if a wallet ID is required to be present in the SDK output and there is no pre-existing wallet.
